# GoBridge talk formula for producing presentation and blog posts

As with any recipe, this formula will work but only if you follow it.

The formula below also works brilliantly for writing blog posts!

You should read Dave Cheney's full blog post [Practical public speaking for Nerds](http://dave.cheney.net/2015/02/17/practical-public-speaking-for-nerds). Below is the most important piece to get your talk/blog post written:

#### Start at the end

In order of importance you need...
- a conclusion
- an introduction
- everything else

The conclusion is your position, your idea, your argument, your call to action, summarised in one slide.

**Donâ€™t start writing until you know how your talk ends.**

The introduction should set the stage for the conclusion.

The rest of the talking points should flow logically from the proposition established in the introduction. They should be relevant and supportive of the conclusion. If a point does not relate to the introduction, or support the conclusion then either rewrite it, drop it, or in extreme cases reconsider your conclusion.

## One additional note

The ideal flow to come up with a presentation is:
- complete the formula
- use the formula to write a blog post
- use the blog post to do your deck
